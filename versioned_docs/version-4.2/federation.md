# Exchange and Queue Federation

This guide covers various topics related to cluster federation, both
of exchanges and queues:

 * [What does federation do?](#what-does-it-do)
 * [Getting started](#getting-started)

 * Monitoring federation [link status](#status)
 * [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)


## Overview {#overview}

The high-level goal of the Federation plugin is to replicate or move messages between brokers that have
the plugin enabled but do not belong to the same cluster. This is useful for a number of reasons.

### Loose Coupling of Nodes or Clusters

The federation plugin can transmit messages between brokers
(or clusters) in different administrative domains:

 * they may be hosted in different data centers, potentially on different continents
 * they may have different users, virtual hosts, permissions and purpose
 * they may run on different versions of RabbitMQ and Erlang
 * they may be of different sizes

### WAN friendliness

The federation plugin communication is entirely asynchronous and assumes that connections between
clusters will fail from time to time. So it tolerates intermittent connectivity
well and does not create coupling between remote clusters (in terms of availability).

### Specificity

A broker can contain federated _and_ local-only components to best
fit the desired architecture of the system.

### Scalability with Growing Connected Node Count

Federation does not require O(n<sup>2</sup>) connections between
_N_ brokers (although this is the easiest way to set things up).


## What Does It Do? {#what-does-it-do}

The federation plugin make it possible to _federate_ exchanges and queues.
A federated exchange or queue can receive
messages from one or more remote clusters called _upstreams_ (to be more precise: exchanges
and queues that exist in remote clusters).

A federated exchange will "replay" a stream of messages published to its upstream counterpart, and publish them to a local queue or stream.

A federated queue lets a local consumer receive messages from an upstream queue when the remote queue
itself does not have any local consumers online.

Federation links connect to upstreams largely the same way an application would. Therefore
they can connect to a specific vhost, use TLS, use multiple
[authentication mechanisms](./authentication).

Typically, federation is used to connect remote clusters. However, it can also be used
to move data between [virtual hosts](./vhosts) within the same cluster.

Federation documentation is organized as a number of more focussed guides:

 * [Exchange federation](./federated-exchanges): for replicating a flow of messages through an exchange to a remote cluster
 * [Queue federation](./federated-queues): to create a "logical queue" across N clusters that will move messages where consumers are (if there are no local consumers)
 * [Federation settings reference](./federation-reference)

## How is Federation Set Up? {#how-is-it-configured}

Two steps are involved in setting up federation:

* First, one or more upstreams must be defined. They provide federation with information about how to connect
  to other nodes. This can be done via [runtime parameters](./parameters)
  or the [federation management plugin](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-federation-management) which
  adds a federation management tab to the [management UI](./management).
* To enable federation, one or more [policies](./policies) that match exchanges or queues must be declared.
  The policy will make the matched objects (e.g. exchanges) federated, and one federation link
  (connection to other nodes) will be started for every match


## Getting Started {#getting-started}

The federation plugin is included in the RabbitMQ distribution. To
enable it, use [rabbitmq-plugins](./cli):

```bash
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_federation
```

If [management UI](./management) is used, it is recommended that
`rabbitmq_federation_management` is also enabled:

```bash
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_federation_management
```

When using a federation in a cluster, all the nodes of the
cluster should have the federation plugin enabled.

Information about federation upstreams is stored in the RabbitMQ
database, along with users, permissions, queues, etc. There
are three levels of configuration involved in federation:

* **Upstreams**: each [upstream](./federation-reference#upstreams) defines a remote connection endpoint.
* **Upstream sets**: each [upstream set groups](./federation-reference#upstream-sets) together a set of upstreams to use for federation.
* **Policies**: each [policy](./policies) selects a set of exchanges,
  queues or both, and applies a single upstream or an upstream
  set to those objects.

In practice, for simple use cases you can almost ignore the
existence of upstream sets, since there is an implicitly-defined upstream set called `all`
to which all upstreams are added.

Upstreams and upstream sets are both defined using [runtime parameters](./parameters).
Like exchanges and queues, each virtual host has its own distinct set of parameters and policies. For more
generic information on parameters and policies, see the guide on
[parameters and policies](./parameters).
For full details on the parameters used by federation, see the [federation reference](./federation-reference).

Parameters and policies can be set in three ways:

 * Using [CLI tools](./cli)
 * In the management UI if an extension plugin (`rabbitmq_federation_management`) is enabled
 * Using the HTTP API

The HTTP API has a limitation: it does not support management of upstream sets.


## A Basic Example {#tutorial}

Here we will federate all the built-in exchanges except for
the default exchange, with a single upstream. The upstream
will be defined to buffer messages when disconnected for up
to one hour (3600000ms).

To define an upstream, use one of the following examples,
one per tab:

<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="bash" label="rabbitmqctl with bash" default>
```bash
# target.hostname is just an example, replace it with a URI
# of the target node (usually a member of a remote node/cluster,
# or a URI that connects to a different virtual host within the same cluster)
rabbitmqctl set_parameter federation-upstream my-upstream \
    '{"uri":"amqp://target.hostname","expires":3600000}'
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rabbitmqadmin" label="rabbitmqadmin with bash">
```bash
# target.hostname is just an example, replace it with a URI
# of the target node (usually a member of a remote node/cluster,
# or a URI that connects to a different virtual host within the same cluster)
rabbitmqadmin federation declare_upstream --name my-upstream \
    --uri "amqp://target.hostname" \
    --ttl 3600000
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="PowerShell" label="rabbitmqctl with PowerShell">
```PowerShell
# target.hostname is just an example, replace it with a URI
# of the target node (usually a member of a remote node/cluster,
# or a URI that connects to a different virtual host within the same cluster)
rabbitmqctl.bat set_parameter federation-upstream my-upstream `
    '"{""uri"":""amqp://target.hostname"",""expires"":3600000}"'
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rabbitmqadmin-PowerShell" label="rabbitmqadmin.exe with PowerShell">
```PowerShell
# target.hostname is just an example, replace it with a URI
# of the target node (usually a member of a remote node/cluster,
# or a URI that connects to a different virtual host within the same cluster)
rabbitmqadmin.exe federation declare_upstream --name my-upstream ^
    --uri "amqp://target.hostname" ^
    --ttl 3600000
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Management UI" label="Management UI">
Navigate to `Admin` > `Federation Upstreams` >
`Add a new upstream`. Enter "my-upstream" next to Name,
"amqp://target.hostname" next to URI, and 36000000 next to
Expiry. Click Add upstream.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="HTTP API" label="HTTP API">
```bash
PUT /api/parameters/federation-upstream/%2f/my-upstream
{"value":{"uri":"amqp://target.hostname","expires":3600000}}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then define a policy that will match built-in exchanges and use this upstream:

<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="bash" label="rabbitmqctl with bash" default>
```bash
rabbitmqctl set_policy --apply-to exchanges federate-me "^amq\." \
    '{"federation-upstream-set":"all"}'
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rabbitmqadmin" label="rabbitmqadmin with bash">
```bash
rabbitmqadmin policies declare \
    --name "federate-me" \
    --pattern "^amq\." \
    --definition '{"federation-upstream-set":"all"}' \
    --apply-to "exchanges"
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="PowerShell" label="rabbitmqctl with PowerShell">
```PowerShell
rabbitmqctl.bat set_policy --apply-to exchanges federate-me "^amq\." `
    '"{""federation-upstream-set"":""all""}"'
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rabbitmqadmin-PowerShell" label="rabbitmqadmin.exe with PowerShell">
```PowerShell
rabbitmqadmin.exe policies declare ^
    --name "federate-me" ^
    --pattern "^amq\." ^
    --definition "{""federation-upstream-set"":""all""}" ^
    --apply-to "exchanges"
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Management UI" label="Management UI">
Navigate to `Admin` > `Policies` > `Add / update a policy`.
Enter "federate-me" next to "Name", "^amq\." next to
"Pattern", choose "Exchanges" from the "Apply to" drop down list
and enter "federation-upstream-set" = "all"
in the first line next to "Policy". Click "Add" policy.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="HTTP API" label="HTTP API">
```ini
PUT /api/policies/%2f/federate-me
{"pattern":"^amq\.", "definition":{"federation-upstream-set":"all"}, "apply-to":"exchanges"}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The defined policy will make the exchanges _whose names
begin with "amq." (all the built-in exchanges except
for the default one) with (implicit) low priority, and
to federate them using the implicitly created upstream set
"all", which includes our newly-created upstream.

Any other [matching policy](./policies) with a priority greater than 0 will take
precedence over this policy. Keep in mind that `federate-me`
is just a name we used for this example, you can use any
string you want there.

The built in exchanges should now be federated because they are
matched by the policy. You can
check that the policy has applied to the exchanges by
checking the exchanges list in management or with:

```bash
rabbitmqctl list_exchanges name policy | grep federate-me
```

And you can check that federation links for each exchange have come up with `Admin` > `Federation Status` > `Running Links` or with:

```bash
# This command will be available only if federation plugin is enabled
rabbitmqctl federation_status
```

In general there will be one federation link for each
upstream that is applied to an exchange. So for example with
three exchanges and two upstreams for each there will be six
links.

For simple use this should be all you need - you will probably
want to look at the <a href="./uri-spec">AMQP URI
reference</a>.

The <a href="./federation-reference">federation reference</a> contains
more details on upstream parameters and upstream sets.


## Federation Connection (Link) Failures {#link-failures}

Inter-node connections used by Federation are based on AMQP 0-9-1
connections. Federation links can be treated as special kind of clients
by operators.

Should a link fail, e.g. due to a network interruption, it will
attempt to re-connect. Reconnection period is a configurable value
that's defined in upstream definition. See
<a href="./federation-reference">federation
reference</a> for more details on setting up upstreams and
upstream sets.

Links generally try to recover ad infinitum but there are scenarios
when they give up:

 * Failure rate is too high (max tolerated rate depends on
   upstream's `reconnect-delay` but is generally a failure
   every few seconds by default).
 * Link no longer can locate its "source" queue or exchange.
 * Policy changes in such a way that a link considers itself no longer necessary.

By increasing `reconnect-delay` for upstreams it is possible
to tolerate higher link failure rates. This is primarily relevant
for RabbitMQ installations where a moderate or large number of active links.


## Federating Clusters {#clustering}

Clusters can be linked together with federation just as single brokers
can. To summarise how clustering and federation interact:

 * You can define policies and parameters on any node in the downstream
   cluster; once defined on one node they will apply on all nodes.
 * Exchange federation links will start on any node in the
   downstream cluster. They will fail over to other nodes if
   the node they are running on crashes or stops.
 * Queue federation links will start on the same node as the
   downstream queue. If the downstream queue is a [replicated one](./quorum-queues), they
   will start on the same node as the leader, and will be
   recreated on the same node as the new leader after any future leader elections.
 * To connect to an upstream cluster, you can specify multiple URIs in
   a single upstream. The federation link process will choose one of
   these URIs at random each time it attempts to connect.


## Securing Federation Connections with TLS {#tls-connections}

:::important

Starting with Erlang 26, [TLS client peer verification](./ssl#peer-verification) is enabled by default by the TLS implementation.

If client TLS certificate and key pair is not configured, TLS-enabled Federation links
will fail to connect. A certificate (public key) and private key
pair must be configured for TLS-enabled Federation links that need to use peer verification.

If peer verification is not necessary, it can be disabled.

:::

Federation connections (links) can be secured with TLS. Because Federation uses
a RabbitMQ client under the hood, it is necessary to both configure
the target broker to [listen for TLS connections](./ssl)
and Federation to use TLS.

To configure Federation to use TLS, one needs to

 * In upstream URI, use the `amqps` for scheme instead of `amqp` and port `5671` instead of `5672` (assuming the default port is used but the port specified explicitly)
 * In the same upstream URI, specify CA certificate and client certificate/key pair, as well as other parameters (namely [enable or disable peer verification](./ssl#peer-verification), [peer verification depth](./ssl#peer-verification-depth)) via [URI query parameters](./uri-query-parameters)
 * Optionally, configure [TLS-related](./ssl/) settings or defaults common for all links (plus, optionally, [Shovel](./shovel)) via the Erlang client settings

In the following example the upstream URI is modified to use TLS with a client certificate (public key)
and private key pair but with peer verification disabled (for simplicity, it is encouraged for production use):

<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="bash" label="rabbitmqctl with bash" default>
```bash
# Note the TLS-related settings in the upstream URI field
rabbitmqctl set_parameter federation-upstream my-upstream \
    '{"uri":"amqps://target.hostname:5671?cacertfile=/path/to/ca_bundle.pem&certfile=/path/to/client_certificate.pem&keyfile=/path/to/client_key.pem&verify=verify_none","expires":3600000}'
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rabbitmqadmin" label="rabbitmqadmin with bash">
```bash
# Note the TLS-related settings in the upstream URI field
rabbitmqadmin federation declare_upstream --name my-upstream \
    --uri "amqps://target.hostname:5671?cacertfile=/path/to/ca_bundle.pem&certfile=/path/to/client_certificate.pem&keyfile=/path/to/client_key.pem&verify=verify_none" \
    --ttl 3600000
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="PowerShell" label="rabbitmqctl with PowerShell">
```PowerShell
#
rabbitmqctl.bat set_parameter federation-upstream my-upstream `
    '"{""uri"":""amqps://target.hostname:5671?cacertfile=drive:\path\to\ca_bundle.pem&certfile=drive:\path\to\client_certificate.pem&keyfile=drive:\path\to\client_key.pem&verify=verify_none"",""expires"":3600000}"'
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="rabbitmqadmin-PowerShell" label="rabbitmqadmin.exe with PowerShell">
```PowerShell
# Note the TLS-related settings in the upstream URI field
rabbitmqadmin.exe federation declare_upstream --name my-upstream ^
    --uri "amqps://target.hostname:5671?cacertfile=drive:\path\to\ca_bundle.pem&certfile=drive:\path\to\client_certificate.pem&keyfile=drive:\path\to\client_key.pem&verify=verify_none" ^
    --ttl 3600000
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Management UI" label="Management UI">
Navigate to `Admin` > `Federation Upstreams` >
`Add a new upstream`. Enter "my-upstream" next to Name, paste
`"amqps://target.hostname:5671?cacertfile=/path/to/ca_bundle.pem&certfile=/path/to/client_certificate.pem&keyfile=/path/to/client_key.pem&verify=verify_none"` for URI,
then enter 36000000 next to Expiry.

Click Add upstream.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="HTTP API" label="HTTP API">
```bash
PUT /api/parameters/federation-upstream/%2f/my-upstream
{"value":{"uri":"amqps://target.hostname:5671?cacertfile=/path/to/ca_bundle.pem&certfile=/path/to/client_certificate.pem&keyfile=/path/to/client_key.pem&verify=verify_none","expires":3600000}}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

These examples use a URI with four additional [URI query parameters](./uri-query-parameters):

 * `cacertfile`: the CA certificate bundle file that includes one or more CA certificates that were used to sign the client certificate and private key pair
 * `certfile`: the client certificate (public key)
 * `keyfile`: the client private key
 * `verify`: [controls peer verification](./ssl#peer-verification) (in this specific example, disables it)

Just like with "regular" client connections, if TLS-enabled federation links need to perform peer verification then server's CA must be
trusted on the node where federation link(s) runs, and vice versa.


## Federation Link Monitoring {#status}

Each combination of federated exchange or queue and upstream needs a
link to run. This is the process that retrieves messages from upstream
and republishes them downstream. You can monitor the status of
federation links using `rabbitmqctl` and the management
plugin.

### Using CLI Tools

Federation link status can be inspected using [RabbitMQ CLI tools](./cli).

Invoke:

```bash
# This command will be available only if federation plugin is enabled
rabbitmqctl federation_status
```

This will output a list of federation links running on the target node (not cluster-wide).
It contains the following keys:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Parameter Name</td>
      <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`type`</td>
      <td>
        `exchange` or `queue` depending on
        what type of federated resource this link relates to
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>`name`</td>
      <td>
        the name of the federated exchange or queue
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>`vhost`</td>
      <td>
        the virtual host containing the federated exchange or queue
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>`upstream_name`</td>
      <td>
        the name of the upstream this link is connected to
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>`status`</td>
      <td>
        status of the link:
          <ul>
            <li>`starting`</li>
            <li>`{running, LocalConnectionName}`</li>
            <li>`{shutdown, Error}`</li>
          </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>`connection`</td>
      <td>
        the name of the connection for this link (from config)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>`timestamp`</td>
      <td>
        time stamp of the last status update
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Here's an example:

```bash
# This command will be available only if federation plugin is enabled
rabbitmqctl federation_status
# => [[{type,<<"exchange">>},
# =>   {name,<<"my-exchange">>},
# =>   {vhost,<<"/">>},
# =>   {connection,<<"upstream-server">>},
# =>   {upstream_name,<<"my-upstream-x">>},
# =>   {status,{running,<<"<rabbit@my-server.1.281.0>">>}},
# =>   {timestamp,{{2020,3,1},{12,3,28}}}]]
# => ...done.
```

### Using the Management UI

Enable the `rabbitmq_federation_management` [plugin](./plugins) that extends
[management UI](./management) with a new page that displays federation links in the cluster.
It can be found under `Admin` > `Federation Status`, or by using the
`GET /api/federation-links` HTTP API endpoint.


## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

### Federation Links Do Not Start

Federation links are started when

* There is a configured upstream (or a set of upstreams)
* There is a policy that matches some exchanges or queues
* Federation can connect to the target upstream

Therefore, in order to narrow down the problem, the recommended steps are:

 * Inspect federation upstreams
 * Inspect [policies](./policies), in particular looking for policies with conflicting [priorities](./policies#priorities)
 * Inspect [node logs](./logging)

#### Inspect Federation Upstreams

```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Management UI" label="Management UI">
Make sure that the `rabbitmq_federation_management` [plugin](./plugins) is enabled.

Navigate to `Admin` > `Federation Upstreams`.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="HTTP API" label="HTTP API">
```ini
GET /api/parameters
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Inspect Policies

Only one policy in RabbitMQ can be applied at a time, and that out of N policies
with equal priorities a random one will be selected.

In other words, when there are conflicting policies that match the exchanges or queues
that are meant to be federated, the policy that enables federation is not guaranteed
to be the effective one.

Using explicit different policies and avoiding policies that `--apply-to all` will reduce
the risk of running into this problem.
