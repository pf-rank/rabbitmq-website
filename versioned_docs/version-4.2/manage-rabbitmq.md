# How to Manage RabbitMQ

This section is mainly for **administrators** who want to operate a single
RabbitMQ instance and clusters of RabbitMQ nodes. It provides documentation for
configuring and managing the RabbitMQ broker.

The next section, [How to Monitor RabbitMQ](./monitoring), is also useful to
setup monitoring RabbitMQ and the applications that use it.
