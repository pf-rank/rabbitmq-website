# How to Enable Khepri

As of RabbitMQ 4.2.0, Khepri became the default metadata store backend for all
new deployments. For existing deployments that used RabbitMQ 4.1.x or older
initially, Khepri has to be explicitly enabled using the `khepri_db` [feature
flag](../feature-flags).

This page demonstrates how to enable Khepri in various situations and what the
user should be aware of.

## Terminology

The [feature flags](../feature-flags) subsystem uses the words *stable* and
*experimental* to qualify feature flags maturity.

An *experimental* feature flag is used in two situations:

1. To introduce changes to get feedback early during the development. These
   changes could be reverted, upgrading a RabbitMQ node with such a feature
   flag enabled may not bo possible and support may not be provided.
2. For features the RabbitMQ team committed to and provides support for, until
   it is ready to be enabled by default, possibly replacing an older system.

Khepri in RabbitMQ 3.13.x was in the first group. Be reassured that Khepri in
RabbitMQ 4.0 and onward is in that second group and is therefore fully
supported.

## On a brand new RabbitMQ node

### Using the CLI

1.  Start the new RabbitMQ node using a method of your choice. The example
    below executes the [`rabbitmq-server(8)`
    command](../man/rabbitmq-server.8) directly:

    <Tabs groupId="examples">
    <TabItem value="bash" label="bash" default>
    ```bash
    rabbitmq-server
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="PowerShell" label="PowerShell">
    ```PowerShell
    rabbitmq-server.bat
    ```
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    At that point, the **node is using Mnesia** as the metadata store backend.

2.  Enable the `khepri_db` feature flag:

    <Tabs groupId="examples">
    <TabItem value="bash" label="bash" default>
    ```bash
    # Opt-in to enable Khepri.
    rabbitmqctl enable_feature_flag --experimental khepri_db
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="PowerShell" label="PowerShell">
    ```PowerShell
    # Opt-in to enable Khepri.
    rabbitmqctl.bat enable_feature_flag --experimental khepri_db
    ```
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

See the next page to learn more about what happens when nodes with Mnesia and
nodes with Khepri are clustered together.

### Using the Management UI

1.  Start the new RabbitMQ node using a method of your choice. See [the
    example above](#using-the-cli).

    At that point, the **node is using Mnesia** as the metadata store backend.

2.  Enable the [management plugin](../management):

    <Tabs groupId="examples">
    <TabItem value="bash" label="bash" default>
    ```bash
    rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="PowerShell" label="PowerShell">
    ```PowerShell
    rabbitmq-plugins.bat enable rabbitmq_management
    ```
    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

3.  Open and log into the [management UI](../management#usage-ui).

4.  Navigate to *"Admin > Feature Flags"*.

5.  Tick *"I understand the risk"* and click the *"Enable"* button:

    <figure className={diagramStyles.diagram}>
    <EnableInUI/>
    <figcaption>The experimental feature flags section in the management
    UI</figcaption>
    </figure>

### Using an Environment Variable

`$RABBITMQ_FEATURE_FLAGS` environment variable can be set to the absolute list
of feature flags to enable at boot time on a new node, or to a relative list
compared to the feature flags enabled by default. This variable is considered
on the very first boot only; it is ignored afterwards.

Start the new RabbitMQ node using a method of your choice, setting the
`$RABBITMQ_FEATURE_FLAGS` variable in the process. The example below executes
the [`rabbitmq-server(8)` command](../man/rabbitmq-server.8) directly:

<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="bash" label="bash" default>
```bash
env RABBITMQ_FEATURE_FLAGS="+khepri_db" rabbitmq-server
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="PowerShell" label="PowerShell">
```PowerShell
$Env:RABBITMQ_FEATURE_FLAGS = '+khepri_db'
rabbitmq-server.bat
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The RabbitMQ node will use Khepri right from the beginning.

## On an Existing Standalone Node or Cluster

Khepri can be enabled when **all cluster nodes are online** and **the cluster
is [healthy](../monitoring)**, like any other feature flag. Khepri cannot be
enabled it while a node or the entire cluster is stopped.

To enable Khepri, use either the [CLI command](#using-the-cli) on the
[management UI](#using-the-management-ui) methods described above.

The migration of the existing data from Mnesia to Khepri runs in parallel of
regular activities of RabbitMQ. However this migration takes resources and
will pause other activities near the end of the process for a short period of
time. Therefore, perform this migration away from peek load.

## What Happens When Khepri is Enabled? {#migration}

The migration from Mnesia to Khepri is the responsibility of the
[`khepri_mnesia_migration`
library](https://rabbitmq.github.io/khepri_mnesia_migration/).

This library performs the migration in two phases:

1. It synchronizes the cluster membership from Mnesia to Khepri.
2. It copies records from Mnesia tables to the Khepri store.

### Step 1: Cluster Membership Synchronization

The common situation is that Khepri is enabled in a Mnesia-based cluster and
thus all nodes involved are single isolated nodes from Khepriâ€™s point of view.

To be extra safe and avoid the loss of data in case some nodes were already
clustered at the Khepri levet too, `khepri_mnesia_migration` uses several
conditions to make sure the Khepri cluster is deterministic. To achieve that,
here are the steps it goes through:

1.  It queries the list of members of the Mnesia cluster. This is the baseline
    list of nodes we want to cluster in Khepri too.

2.  It queries each node to get the members of the Khepri cluster. Usually,
    Khepri was not clustered yet, so each node just returns itself.

3.  It sorts the list of Khepri "clusters" according to the following
    criterias:

    1. the cluster size (i.e. the number of members)
    2. the number of records in the Khepri store
    3. the node uptime
    4. the node name

    Therefore, in the case some nodes were already clustered at the Khepri
    level, the Khepri clusters will be sorted with the largest cluster (set of
    nodes) first.

    But usually, nodes will be unclustered and thus sorted by node uptime and
    name.

4.  It selects the largest Khepri "cluster" according to the criteria above
    and adds all other nodes to that largest cluster

5.  If some nodes were clustered at the Khepri level but were not in Mnesia,
    they are removed from Khepri

### Step 2: Schema Records Copy

Once the cluster membership view is the same between Mnesia and Khepri,
`khepri_mnesia_migration` can proceed with the actual migration of the data.
It performs the copy while permitting writes in Mnesia until the very last
moment.

The copy relies on callback modules provided by RabbitMQ. These callack
modules are responsible for telling `khepri_mnesia_migration` that record
`$record` from table `$table` goes into Khepri path `$path`, after possibly
doing some record conversion.

Here are the steps of the data copying algorithm:

1.  `khepri_mnesia_migration` marks the migration in progress as value in
    Khepri.

2.  It subscribes to all Mnesia updates.

3.  It does the first copy from Mnesia to Khepri using Mnesia Backup & Restore
    API. This is based on a checkpoint in time in Mnesia, therefore the view
    is consistent.

4.  It marks all Mnesia tables as read-only. This is where activities in
    RabbitMQ are paused. Client operations may time out as a consequence.

5.  All updates received thanks to the Mnesia subscription in step 2 are now
    consumed and written to Khepri. Because tables are read-only, it is sure
    there is an end to the stream of updates.

6.  It marks the migration as complete. RabbitMQ can resume activities: they
    will use Khepri from now on.

7.  It proceeds with the cleanup: tables are deleted.

### Rollback In Case of an Error

If there is an error during this process, everything is rolled back and
RabbitMQ will resume activities using Mnesia as before.
