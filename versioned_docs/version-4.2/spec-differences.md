## Undeprecated Features

In addition to extensions beyond the specification, RabbitMQ also undeprecates some features that were removed from AMQP 0-9-1:

  * [Auto-delete exchanges](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/exchanges#auto-deletion)
  * Internal exchanges

The access class was deprecated from AMQP 0-9-1. RabbitMQ implements the
`access.request` method from this class as a no-op in order to maintain compatibility with older clients.

This method will be removed in the future and should not be relied upon.

## amq.* Exchange Immutability

AMQP 0-9-1 spec dictates that it must not be possible to declare an exchange with the <span class="code">amq.</span> prefix. RabbitMQ also prohibits deletion of such exchanges.
