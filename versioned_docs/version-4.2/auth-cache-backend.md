# Authentication/Authorization Cache Backend

## Overview {#overview}

This plugin provides a way to cache authentication and authorization backend 
results for a configurable amount of time. It's not an independent auth backend,
but a caching layer for existing backends, such as the built-in, [LDAP](./ldap),
or [HTTP](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/main/deps/rabbitmq_auth_backend_http) ones.
Although it is not very useful with the 
built-in (internal) [authentication and authorization backends](./access-control) but can be other
backends that use network requests, such as LDAP or HTTP.

Cache expiration is currently time-based.

## Installation {#installation}

The `rabbitmq_auth_backend_cache` plugin ships with RabbitMQ.

Like all plugins, it [must be enabled](./plugins) before it can be used, for example,
use [`rabbitmqctl`](./cli):

```bash
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_auth_backend_cache
```

## Authorization and Authentication Backend Configuration {#configuration}

To configure this plugin so that it caches all the authorization and authentication
decisions, first set this cache backend as the `auth_backends` or one
of them and then you configure which authentication backend is actually cached.

For example, to cache requests to the `http` backend:

```ini
auth_backends.1 = cache
auth_cache.cached_backend = http

auth_http.http_method = post
```

It is possible to use different backends for authorization and authentication.

The following example configures the plugin to use LDAP backend for 
authentication, but internal backend for authorization:

```ini 
auth_backends.1 = cache

auth_cache.cached_backend.authn = ldap
auth_cache.cached_backend.authz = internal
```

## Basic Cache configuration {#basic-configuration}

You can configure TTL for cache items, by using `cache_ttl` configuration variable, 
specified in milliseconds. The default value is `15000` milliseconds:

```ini 
auth_cache.cached_backend = ldap
auth_cache.cache_ttl = 5000
```

By default, negative authentication and/or authorization decisions are not cached,
only positive ones are. However, this behaviour can be changed by setting `cache_refusals` to `true`
as shown below: 

```ini
auth_cache.cache_refusals = true
```

## Advanced Cache configuration {#advanced-configuration}

You can also use a custom cache module to store cached requests. This module 
should be an Erlang module implementing the `rabbit_auth_cache` behavior and
(optionally) define `start_link` function to start the cache process.

This repository provides several implementations:

* `rabbit_auth_cache_dict` stores cache entries in the internal process dictionary.
  This module is for demonstration only and should not be used in production.
* `rabbit_auth_cache_ets` stores cache entries in an [ETS](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/ets) 
  table and uses timers for cache invalidation. **This is the default implementation**.
* `rabbit_auth_cache_ets_segmented` stores cache entries in multiple ETS tables 
  and does not delete individual cache items but rather uses a separate process for garbage collection.
* `rabbit_auth_cache_ets_segmented_stateless` same as previous, but with minimal
   use of `gen_server` state, using ets tables to store information about segments.

To specify the module for caching, use the `cache_module` configuration key.
This example configuration configures the `rabbit_auth_backend_ets_segmented` module.

```ini 
auth_cache.cache_module = rabbit_auth_backend_ets_segmented
```

When using a custom implementation of a `cache_module`, you can specify `start args`
with `cache_module_args`. `Start args` should be list of arguments passed to 
module `start_link` function.

However, additional cache module arguments can only be defined via the 
[advanced.config](./configure#advanced-config-file).

```erlang 
[
 {rabbit, [
   %% ...
 ]},

 {rabbitmq_auth_backend_cache, [
    {cache_module, rabbit_auth_backend_ets_segmented},
    {cache_module_args, [10000]}
  ]}
].
```


## How to Clear the Cache

A [`rabbitmqctl`](./man/rabbitmqctl.8) command `clear_auth_backend_cache`
can be used  to clear the cache across all cluster nodes:

```bash 
rabbitmqctl clear_auth_backend_cache
```
