# Troubleshooting OAuth 2

## Overview {#overview}

This guide covers the most common errors encountered using [OAuth 2.0](./oauth2) and the [management plugin](./management) and how to diagnose them.

## Troubleshooting Client Connections

### Maximum JWT Token Length Limit

#### Steps to reproduce

A client can run into a maximum messaging protocol frame limit exception when connecting
a node that is configured to use JWT tokens for authentication and authorization.

#### Troubleshooting

Depending on the encoded content, JWT tokens can vary greatly in length.
Messaging protocols supported by RabbitMQ have practical limits on the maximum
frame length.

The default is usually much higher than a practically possible JWT token length,
for example, for AMQP 0-9-1 and the [RabbitMQ Stream Protocol](./stream) the default
is 128 kB. However, the maximum frame limit can be overriden [via `rabbitmq.conf`](./configure) and via client library configuration.

If a long token is provided by a client and a lower limit is configured, the connection will be refused with
a "frame length exceeded", "frame is too large" and similar error messages
in [server logs](./logging).

For example, in the case of AMQP 0-9-1 it would look like this:

```
2025-03-15 05:55:21.689185+00:00 [info] <0.2771.0> accepting AMQP connection <0.2771.0> (10.8.121.164:45024 -> 10.8.121.141:5672)
2025-03-15 05:55:24.745906+00:00 [error] <0.2771.0> closing AMQP connection <0.2771.0> (10.8.121.164:45024 -> 10.8.121.141:5672):
2025-03-15 05:55:24.745906+00:00 [error] <0.2771.0> {handshake_error,starting,0,
2025-03-15 05:55:24.745906+00:00 [error] <0.2771.0>                  {amqp_error,frame_error,
2025-03-15 05:55:24.745906+00:00 [error] <0.2771.0>                              "type 1, all octets = <<>>: {frame_too_large,6307,4088}",
2025-03-15 05:55:24.745906+00:00 [error] <0.2771.0>                              none}}
```

There are two solutions available:

1. Increase the `initial_frame_max` value in `rabbitmq.conf`, or `rabbit.initial_frame_max` in `advanced.config`
2. Reduce the token content size, for example, by dropping certain scopes that are not used by RabbitMQ or optimizing (simplifying) them

#### Increase the Initial Frame Size Limit

The following `rabbitmq.conf` example increases the initial frame size limit to 8192 bytes (from the default of 4096 bytes):

```ini
initial_frame_max = 8192
```

the same example using `advanced.config`:

```erl
[
  {rabbit, [
    {initial_frame_max, 8192}
  ]}
].
```

#### Reduce the JWT Token Payload Size

JWT token size can often be reduced by dropping certain scopes that are not used by RabbitMQ.
Alternatively, a new JWT token can be generated with a more narrow set of scopes
and thus a smaller size.


## Troubleshooting OAuth 2 in the management UI {#management-ui}

### OpenId Discovery endpoint not reachable {#openid-discovery-endpoint-not-reachable-error}

#### Steps to reproduce

Open the root URL of the management UI in the browser.
Rather than getting the button "Click here to login" you see the following error message:

```
OAuth resource [rabbitmq] not available. OpenId Discovery endpoint https://<the_issuer_url>/.well-known/openid-configuration not reachable
```

#### Troubleshooting

These are the most common reasons for this issue:

* The endpoint is unreachable, for example, there is a firewall which blocks access or a target service is down
* The endpoint has a [TLS certificate not trusted](./ssl#peer-verification) by the browser
* The browser is blocking access due to a [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) policy

The quickest way to identity the root cause is by opening the browser's JavaScript console and searching for `net::ERR_`.
The most likely errors are:

* `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`: the endpoint is down or is unreachable
* `net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID`: the endpoint's [TLS certificate is not trusted](./ssl#peer-verification) by the browser. To trust this certificate, click on the URL in the error message and follow the prompt

If no errors match `net::ERR`, search for `CORS`. If there is an error similar to the following one

```
Access to fetch at 'https://<the_issuer_url>>/.well-known/openid-configuration' from origin
'<rabbitmq_url_to_management_ui>' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

then the browser is blocking the response returned by the endpoint and therefore it is not being delivered it to the management UI.
This is due to a [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) policy.
Ask the administrator of the Identity Provider to add the management UI's URL to the list of allowed **origins**.


### OpenId Discovery endpoint not compliant {#openid-discovery-endpoint-not-compliant-error}

#### Steps to reproduce

Open the root url of the management UI in the browser.
Rather than getting the button "Click here to login" you see the following error message:

```
OAuth resource [rabbitmq] not available. OpenId Discovery endpoint https://<the_issuer_url>/.well-known/openid-configuration not compliant
```

#### Troubleshooting

This issue is caused when the endpoint is not returning a JSON payload which matches with the [OpenId Connect Discovery Configuration](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig).
These are the possible causes:
- The payload returned by the endpoint is not compliant because it is empty or it is missing some critical information. To identify the root cause, open the browser's JavaScript console and search for one of these possible error messages:
  - `Payload does not contain openid configuration` This error occurs when the payload is empty or it is not a JSON payload.
  - `Missing authorization_endpoint` This error occurs when the JSON attribute `authorization_endpoint` is missing.
  - `Missing token_endpoint` This error occurs when the JSON attribute `token_endpoint` is missing.
  - `Missing jwks_uri` This error occurs when the JSON attribute `jwks_uri` is missing.
- The URL is wrong. Retrieve the correct url to the OpenId Connect Discovery endpoint from your identity provider administrator.

### Not authorized {#not-authorized-error}

#### Steps to reproduce

Open the root URL of the management UI in the browser. Click on the button "Click here to logon" and
enter the credentials requested by the identity provider.

You are redirected back to the management UI with the following error:

```
Not authorized
```

#### Troubleshooting

This issue occurs when the token does not have enough scopes or permissions to access the management UI. You need at least one of these scopes or the equivalent scope:

* `rabbitmq.tag:administrator`.
* `rabbitmq.tag:management`.
* `rabbitmq.tag:monitoring`.
* `rabbitmq.tag:policymaker`.

Follow these steps to find out which scopes or permissions are carried in the token:
1. Open your browwser's developer tool (for example, in Chrome or Firefox, right-click on the page and click on *Inspect* menu option)
2. Go to the *Application* tab
3. Select the option *Storage* > *Local Storage* in the left panel
4. Click on the tree option which matches the URL of the management UI
5. Select the Key *rabbitmq.credentials* in the right panel
6. Copy its value
7. Navigate to https://jwt.io
8. Paste the value into the text field *Encoded*
9. Look at the payload's text field *Decoded*
10. Search for the token attribute `scope` in the tokens' payload or for the value configured in `auth_oauth2.additional_scopes_key`, if any
11. Once you found the appropriate token's scope attribute, find within the attribute's value any of the scopes listed above. If [auth_oauth2.scope_prefix](./oauth2#scope-prefix) is used, it must be taken into account: the scopes will be named like  `myprefix_tag:administrator`. If [scope aliases](./oauth2-examples#using-scope-aliases) are used, find the scope alias that maps to one of the scopes listed above


### OpenId Discovery endpoint unreachable due to bad certificate {#openid-discovery-endpoint-bad-certificate}

This issue is not necessarily specific to the management UI, it may also occur when an application is authenticating via one of the messaging protocols. It occurs when RabbitMQ has to download the OpenId Connect configuration via the url configured in `auth_oauth2.issuer` and the certificate used by the issuer uses a wildcard certificate. This means that the certificate's CN attribute does not match exactly the issuer's domain name. This is very common on SaaS deployments.

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Open the root URL of the management UI in the browser.
2. Click on "Click here to login".
3. Enter your credentials.
4. You are redirected back to RabbitMQ but with an error "No Authorized".

#### Troubleshooting

1. Access the RabbitMQ logs
2. Look for `{bad_cert,hostname_check_failed}`
3. If you find an entry, it means that RabbitMQ tried to contact the URL found in `auth_oauth2.issuer` and the issuer presented a wildcard certificate
4. To fix this issue, add the following line to `rabbitmq.conf`: `auth_oauth2.https.hostname_verification = wildcard`, or `auth_oauth2.oauth_providers.<my_oauth_provider_name>.https.hostname_verification = wildcard` if multiple identity providers are used
