## If you are a Developer

You might want to start with [Getting Started](/tutorials) if you are new to
RabbitMQ. These tutorials will guide you on how to use RabbitMQ.

If you are familiar with RabbitMQ, go directly to the **How to Use RabbitMQ**
information to start exploring it.

## If you are an Administrator

The table of contents for administrators is structured this way:

- The **How to Manage RabbitMQ** section provides documentation for configuring
  and managing the RabbitMQ broker.
- The **How to Monitor RabbitMQ** section includes information which will guide
  you on how to setup monitoring for RabbitMQ and the applications that use it.
