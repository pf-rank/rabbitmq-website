# Metadata store

## Role of the metadata store

The metadata store is the database where RabbitMQ records everything except
queue and stream messages:

* users and permissions in the internal data store; "internal" as opposed to
  users defined externally, for instance, [LDAP](./ldap)
* [virtual hosts](./vhosts)
* topology: exchanges, queues, streams, bindings
* [runtime parameters](./parameters)
* [policies](./policies)

In a cluster, the metadata store is responsible for replicating that across
all RabbitMQ nodes.

The metadata store subsystem relies on a backend library to provide the
database, its replication algorithm and failure recovery characteristics.

## Supported Backends

RabbitMQ supports two different metadata stores:

* Khepri (newer, recommended)
* Mnesia (the original metadata store)

Only one of them is used at a given time. Each one is described below.

### Mnesia

Mnesia is the original backend, and the only backend used by RabbitMQ until
RabbitMQ 3.13.x. This library is part of Erlang/OTP’s standard distribution.

It is reasonably efficient, provides transactions and cluster replication, an
API for backup and restore and, being a native Erlang/OTP library, is
perfectly integrated in any Erlang application.

Mnesia’s **weakness is its failure recovery characteristics**, in particular
when it comes to network partitions. Its replication algorithm assumes that
the system that uses Mnesia can afford to throw away all data on one side of a
network partition, which is not always the case and does not match the
expectations of many technical operations teams.

With Mnesia, it’s up to RabbitMQ to resolve conflicts in the data if two nodes
could not communicate for a while and the database was updated on one side
(e.g. a queue was declared).

To deal with this, [network partition strategies](./partitions) were
introduced in RabbitMQ. However they are by no means a fundamental solution
and are difficult to reason about.

### Khepri

Khepri is a fully supported metadata store starting with RabbitMQ 4.0.x. It is
developed by the RabbitMQ team and reuses a lot of the work done for [quorum
queues](./quorum-queues) and [streams](./streams).

Indeed all these components are based on the [Raft consensus
algorithm](https://raft.github.io/). Therefore the behavior is well defined in
the case of a loss of connectivity and is way easier to reason about. The
behavior is also consistent across RabbitMQ components and subsystems because
they all use the same algorithm.

The goal is to ultimately switch to Khepri only and stop using Mnesia.
However, the use of Khepri is a breaking change compared to Mnesia —&nbsp;even
though it is an internal piece&nbsp;— because it affects various user-visible
parts behavior when the cluster or the network have a bad day.

If you want to learn more about Khepri and its intagration into RabbitMQ,
Michael Davis, who works on this project, made a presentation at the Code BEAM
Europe 2023 confenence. You can watch the [recording of "Khepri: Replacing
Mnesia in RabbitMQ"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whVqpgvep90) on YouTube.

:::tip
Khepri will become the default backend in RabbitMQ 4.2.0.

Mnesia will still be supported. An existing RabbitMQ deployment will continue
to use it once upgraded to RabbitMQ 4.2.x until Khepri is explicitly enabled
by the administrator.

Mnesia support will be removed in a future version. That is why **the RabbitMQ
team encourages users to test their workload and applications with Khepri** to
truely mature it to become the future default (and only) metadata store in
RabbitMQ.

The few next pages will explain how to enable Khepri and will cover these
changes of behavior for various daily operations.
