# RabbitMQ Core vs Stream Plugin

## Overview {#overview}

This section covers the differences between [RabbitMQ core](./streams) and the [stream plugin](./stream).
Stream core designates stream features in the broker with only default plugins activated and through protocols like AMQP 0.9.1, AMQP 1.0, MQTT, and STOMP.


### Feature Matrix

|Feature | RabbitMQ Core              | Stream Plugin    |
|-| ------------------------ | -------------    |
|Activation| Built-in                 | [Must be activated](./stream#enabling-plugin)  |
|Protocol| AMQP 0.9.1 and AMQP 1.0   | [RabbitMQ Stream](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/v3.12.x/deps/rabbitmq_stream/docs/PROTOCOL.adoc)  |
|Clients| AMQP 0.9.1 clients ([documentation](./streams#usage)). AMQP 1.0 clients ([documentation](/client-libraries/amqp-client-libraries#support-for-streams)) |[RabbitMQ stream clients](./stream#overview)   |
|Port| 5672                     | 5552             |
|Format| Server-side AMQP 1.0 message format encoding and decoding  | Client-side AMQP 1.0 message format encoding and decoding |
|Sub-entry batching|  Supported (uncompressed)  | Supported ([Java example](https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-stream-java-client/snapshot/htmlsingle/#sub-entry-batching-and-compression)). [Clients Compression Options](#stream-clients-sub-entry-batching-compression-options)      |
|Offset tracking| Use external store      |  Built-in server-side support ([Java example](https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-stream-java-client/snapshot/htmlsingle/#consumer-offset-tracking)) or external store      |
|Publishing deduplication|Not supported       |  Supported ([Java example](https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-stream-java-client/snapshot/htmlsingle/#outbound-message-deduplication))        |
|[Super stream](/blog/2022/07/13/rabbitmq-3-11-feature-preview-super-streams) |Not supported       |  Supported         |
|Throughput| Hundreds of thousands per second | Millions messages per second    |
|TLS|Supported (default port: 5671)                     | Supported (default port: 5551)


### Interoperabilty

Streams store messages using the AMQP 1.0 message format.

* RabbitMQ Stream client libraries are expected to support the AMQP 1.0 message format
* The broker handles the [conversion](./conversions) between AMQP 1.0 and AMQP 0.9.1 for AMQP 0.9.1 clients
* AMQP 0.9.1,AMQP 1.0 and stream clients can write to and read from the same stream. [Sub-Entry Batching](https://rabbitmq.github.io/rabbitmq-stream-java-client/snapshot/htmlsingle/#sub-entry-batching-and-compression) is supported without compression.
* RabbitMQ Stream supports the following section of the AMQP 1.0 message format:
     * properties
     * application properties
     * application data
     * message annotations

### Stream Clients Sub-entry Batching Compression Options

The compression happens client-side. The available compression implementations:
- No compression
- Gzip 
- Snappy
- LZ4
- Zstd

The table below explains what options are supported by a number of RabbitMQ Stream Protocol clients: 
 

|Client | Supported        | No Compression|Gzip| Snappy | LZ4 | Zstd |
