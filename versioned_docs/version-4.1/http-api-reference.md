# HTTP API Reference

## Introduction {#intro}

This is a reference page for the [RabbitMQ HTTP API](./management#http-api).

## Client Libraries for the HTTP API

There are several mature HTTP API client libraries available,
see [Developer Tools](/client-libraries/devtools).

## HTTP API-based CLI Tool

In addition to client libraries, there is an HTTP API-specific CLI tool
for both interactive and script use.

See [rabbitmqadmin v2, a Command Line Tool for the HTTP API](./management-cli) to learn more.


## Overview {#overview}

<p>All HTTP API API endpoints will serve only resources
of type <code>application/json</code>, and will require HTTP basic
authentication (using the standard RabbitMQ user database). The
default user is guest/guest.</p>

<p>Many URIs require the name of a virtual host as part of the
path, since names only uniquely identify objects within a virtual
host. As the default virtual host is called "<code>/</code>", this
will need to be encoded as "<code>%2F</code>".</p>

<p>PUTing a resource creates it. The JSON object you upload must
have certain mandatory keys (documented below) and may have
optional keys. Other keys are ignored. Missing mandatory keys
constitute an error.</p>

<p>Since bindings do not have names or IDs in AMQP we synthesise
one based on all its properties. Since predicting this name is
hard in the general case, you can also create bindings by POSTing
to a factory URI. See the example below.</p>

<p>Many URIs return lists. Such URIs can have the query string
parameters <code>sort</code> and <code>sort_reverse</code>
added. <code>sort</code> allows you to select a primary field to
sort by, and <code>sort_reverse</code> will reverse the sort order
if set to <code>true</code>. The <code>sort</code> parameter can
contain subfields separated by dots. This allows you to sort by a
nested component of the listed items; it does not allow you to
sort by more than one field. See the example below.</p>

<p>You can also restrict what information is returned per item
with the <code>columns</code> parameter. This is a comma-separated
list of subfields separated by dots. See the example below.</p>

<p>
  It is possible to disable the statistics in the GET requests
  and obtain just the basic information of every object. This reduces
  considerably the amount of data returned and the memory and resource
  consumption of each query in the system. For some monitoring and operation
  purposes, these queries are more appropriate.

  To opt out of the additional metrics, set the <code>disable_stats</code> query parameter
  to <code>true</code>
</p>


## Deprecated Endpoints

:::danger

Avoid relying on deprecated endpoints. They eventually become no-ops
or can be removed entirely.

:::

### GET /api/aliveness-check

`GET /api/aliveness-check` is an HTTP API equivalent of `rabbitmqctl node_health_check`:
a long deprecated intrusive, opinionated health check command that has been a no-op
since `4.0`.

This endpoint has been deprecated since 2021 and is a no-op starting
with RabbitMQ `4.1.0`.



## Endpoint Reference

:::tip

The examples below use [`rabbitmqadmin` v2](./management-cli/) or [`curl`](https://curl.se/).

However, the API can be used with any HTTP client. Team RabbitMQ strongly recommends a number of
[dedicated HTTP API client libraries](/client-libraries/devtools/).

:::

:::tip

The examples that produce JSON output also format the output with [`jq`](https://jqlang.org/).
The use of `jq` is entirely optional.

:::

Exports cluster-wide definitions: all exchanges, queues, bindings, users,
virtual hosts, permissions, topic permissions, and parameters.
That is, everything apart from messages.

#### Examples

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Relevant documentation guide: <a href="./definitions">Definition Export and Import</a>.

### POST /api/definitions

The server definitions: exchanges, queues, bindings, users,
virtual hosts, permissions, topic permissions, and parameters. Everything apart from
messages. POST to upload an existing set of definitions. Note
that:

<ul>
  <li>
    Cluster-wide definitions use a different format from the virtual host-specific ones.
    Virtual host-specific definitions cannot be imported using this endpoint.
    Use the `POST /api/definitions/{vhost}` endpoint instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    The definitions are merged. Anything already existing on
    the server but not in the uploaded definitions is
    untouched.
  </li>
  <li>
    Conflicting definitions on immutable objects (exchanges,
    queues and bindings) will be ignored. The existing definition
    will be preserved.
  </li>
  <li>
    Conflicting definitions on mutable objects will cause
    the object in the server to be overwritten with the
    object from the definitions.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the event of an error you will be left with a
    partially-applied set of definitions.
  </li>
</ul>

This endpoint supports <code>multipart/form-data</code> as
well as the standard <code>application/json</code> content types for uploads.
In the former case, the definitions file should be uploaded as a form field named "file".

Relevant documentation guide: <a href="./definitions">Definition Export and Import</a>.

### GET /api/definitions/\{_vhost_\}

Exports definitions of a single virtual host.

Virtual host-specific definitions do not contain any details on the virtual
host name, and can be imported into any virtual host. That is, the original name
of the virtual host does not have to match the name of the target virtual host
when the definitions are imported.

Relevant documentation guide: <a href="./definitions">Definition Export and Import</a>.

permissions in that virtual host, topic permissions, and parameters.

Note that:

<ul>
  <li>
    Cluster-wide definitions cannot be imported using this endpoint.
    Use the `POST /api/definitions/` endpoint instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    Virtual host-specific definitions do not contain any details on the virtual
    host name, and can be imported into any virtual host. That is, the original name
    of the virtual host does not have to match the name of the target virtual host
    when the definitions are imported.

    The definitions are merged. Anything already existing on
    the server but not in the uploaded definitions is
    untouched.
  </li>
  <li>
    Conflicting definitions on immutable objects (exchanges,
    queues and bindings) will be ignored. The existing definition
    will be preserved.

### PUT /api/exchanges/\{_vhost_\}/\{_name_\}

Declares an exchange.

Payload example:

```json
{
  "type": "direct",
  "auto_delete": false,
  "durable": true,
  "internal": false,
  "arguments": {}
}
```

### DELETE /api/exchanges/\{_vhost_\}/\{_name_\}

Deletes an exchange. Set the `if-unused` query parameter to `true`
to make the operaion a no-op if the exchange is bound to a queue
or as a source to another exchange

### GET /api/exchanges/\{_vhost_\}/\{_name_\}/bindings/source

A list of all bindings in which a given exchange is the source.

```json
{
  "properties": {},
  "routing_key": "my key",
  "payload": "my body",
  "payload_encoding": "string"
}
```

All keys are mandatory.

The `payload_encoding` key should be either "string" (in which case the payload
will be taken to be the UTF-8 encoding of the payload field)
or "base64" (in which case the payload field is taken to be base64 encoded).

If the message is published successfully, the response will
look like:

```json
{"routed": true}
```

`routed` will be true if the message was sent to
at least one queue.

:::danger

Note that the HTTP API is a highly inefficient option for publishing;

Prefer AMQP 1.0, AMQP 0-9-1, the RabbitMQ Streaming Protocol or any other messaging protocol
supported by RabbitMQ.

### GET /api/queues

A list of all queues across all virtual hosts returning a reduced set of fields.

Use <a href="#pagination">pagination parameters</a> to list queues,
otherwise this endpoint can produce very large JSON responses and waste a lot of bandwidth and CPU resources.
Default page size is 100, maximum supported page size is 500.

The parameter <code>enable_queue_totals=true</code> can be used in combination with the
<code>disable_stats=true</code> parameter to return a reduced set of fields and significantly
reduce the amount of data returned by this endpoint. That in turn can significantly reduce
CPU and bandwidth footprint of such requests.

Two query string parameters, `if-empty=true` and/or `if-unused=true`,
can be used for conditional deletion.

### GET /api/queues/\{_vhost_\}/\{_name_\}/bindings

A list of all bindings on a given queue.

### DELETE /api/queues/\{_vhost_\}/\{_name_\}/contents

Purges a queue (deletes all messages in Ready state in it).

### POST /api/queues/\{_vhost_\}/\{_name_\}/get

Get messages from a queue. (This is not an HTTP GET as it
will alter the state of the queue.) You should post a body looking like:

```json
{
  "count": 5,
  "ackmode": "ack_requeue_true",
  "encoding": "auto",
  "truncate": 50000
}
```

`count` controls the maximum number of
messages that can be returned (fetched) at once.

The `ackmode` parameter controls how the consumed [messages are acknowledged](./confirms).
The supported values are

<ul>
  <li>`ack_requeue_true`</li>: requeues the fetched messages
  <li>`reject_requeue_true`</li>: requeues the fetched messages
  <li>`ack_requeue_false`</li>: positively acknowledges the messages and marks them for deletion
  <li>`reject_requeue_false`</li>: negatively acknowledges the messages and marks them for deletion
</ul>

The `encoding` can be either `"auto"` (the payload will be returned as a UTF-8 encoded string if the payload is valid UTF-8)
or "base64" (a Base64-encoded payload).

If the `truncate` key is set to a value in bytes, messages longer than the value will be truncated.

:::danger

This endpoint intended for development and troubleshooting only, not for production.
In production, use a messaging or streaming protocol client library instead.

### GET /api/bindings/\{_vhost_\}/e/\{_exchange_\}/q/\{_queue_\}

Returns a list of all bindings between an exchange and a queue.

An exchange and a queue can be bound together many times,
so this list can contain multiple bindings for the same pair.

### POST /api/bindings/\{_vhost_\}/e/\{_exchange_\}/q/\{_queue_\}

Binds a queue to an exchange.

Request body should be a JSON object optionally containing
two fields, `routing_key` (a string) and `arguments` (a map of optional arguments):

```json
{
  "routing_key": "my_routing_key",
  "arguments": {"x-optional-arg": "optional-value"}
}
```

Both payload keys are optional.

The response will contain a `Location` header
with a URI of the newly declared binding.

### GET /api/bindings/\{_vhost_\}/e/\{_exchange_\}/q/\{_queue_\}/\{_props_\}

Retrieves an individual binding between an exchange and a queue.

The \{_props_\} part of the URI is a "name" for the binding
composed of its routing key and a hash of its arguments.

\{_props_\} is the field named `properties_key` from a bindings listing response.

### DELETE /api/bindings/\{_vhost_\}/e/\{_exchange_\}/q/\{_queue_\}/\{_props_\}

Deletes an individual binding between an exchange and a queue.

The \{_props_\} part of the URI is a "name" for the binding
composed of its routing key and a hash of its arguments.

\{_props_\} is the field named `properties_key` from a bindings listing response.

### GET /api/bindings/\{_vhost_\}/e/\{_source_\}/e/\{_destination_\}

### POST /api/bindings/\{_vhost_\}/e/\{_source_\}/e/\{_destination_\}

Creates a new [exchange-to-exchange binding](./e2e/).

Request body should be a JSON object optionally containing two fields,
`routing_key` (a string) and `arguments` (a map of optional arguments):

```json
{
  "routing_key": "my_routing_key",
  "arguments": {
    "x-arg": "value"
  }
}
```

Both of the keys are optional.

The response will contain a `Location` header
with a URI of the newly declared binding.

### GET /api/bindings/\{_vhost_\}/e/\{_source_\}/e/\{_destination_\}/\{_props_\}

Returns the details of a specific [exchange-to-exchange binding](./e2e/).

### DELETE /api/bindings/\{_vhost_\}/e/\{_source_\}/e/\{_destination_\}/\{_props_\}

Deletes an [exchange-to-exchange binding](./e2e/).

### GET /api/vhosts

### GET /api/vhosts/\{_name_\}

Returns metrics of a specific virtual host.

### PUT /api/vhosts/\{_name_\}

Creates a virtual host or updates the metadata of an existing virtual host.

Payload example:

```json
{
  "description": "virtual host description",
  "tags": "accounts,production",
  "default_queue_type": "quorum",
  "protected_from_deletion": false
}
```

The `tags` key must be a comma-separated list of tags.
These metadata fields are optional.

To enable or disable tracing, use the `tracing` key:

```json
{"tracing":true}
```

### DELETE /api/vhosts/\{_name_\}

Deletes a virtual host, as long as it is not deletion-protected.

### GET /api/vhosts/\{_name_\}/permissions

A list of all permissions for a given virtual host.

### GET /api/vhosts/\{_name_\}/topic-permissions

A list of all topic permissions for a given virtual host.

### POST /api/vhosts/\{_name_\}/deletion/protection

Protects a virtual host from deletion. Virtual hosts marked as protected
cannot be deleted until the protection is lifted.

### DELETE /api/vhosts/\{_name_\}/deletion/protection

Removes deletion protection from a virtual host so that it
can be deleted.

### POST /api/vhosts/\{_name_\}/start/\{_node_\}

Starts or restarts a virtual host on the node.

Doing this explicitly is almost never necessary. RabbitMQ nodes ensure
that all virtual hosts have been started on all cluster nodes for the first
few minutes after cluster formation (more specifically after each cluster member's startup time).

### GET /api/users

Lists all users in the cluster. This only includes the [users in the internal data store](./access-control/).
For example, if the [LDAP backend](./ldap/) is used, this command will not include any LDAP users.

<Tabs groupId="examples">
<TabItem value="rabbitmqadmin" label="rabbitmqadmin v2">

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### GET /api/users/without-permissions

Lists the users that do not have any permissions (cannot access any virtual hosts) and
could be safely deleted.

### POST /api/users/bulk-delete

Bulk deletes a list of users. The payload must include the `users` key that is an array of usernames:

```json
{"users" : ["user1", "user2", "user3"]}
```

### GET /api/users/\{_name_\}

Returns information about a user in the internal data store.

### PUT /api/users/\{_name_\}

Creates a user. A password or a password hash must be provided
in the payload:

```json
{"password":"secret","tags":"administrator"}
```

```json
{"password_hash":"2lmoth8l4H0DViLaK9Fxi6l9ds8=", "tags":["administrator"]}
```

`password_hash` must be generated using the algorithm described
[in the Passwords guide](./passwords/).

The `tags` key takes a comma-separated list of tags.

If neither are set the user will not be able to log in with a password,
but other mechanisms like client certificates may be used.

Setting `password_hash` to an empty string (`""`) will ensure the
user cannot use a password to log in.

The hash function can be overriden using the `hashing_algorithm`
key. Currently recognised algorithms are `rabbit_password_hashing_sha256`,
`rabbit_password_hashing_sha512`, and `rabbit_password_hashing_md5`.


### DELETE /api/users/\{_name_\}

```

An example request using `curl`:

```shell
curl -4u 'guest:guest' -H 'content-type:application/json' -X PUT localhost:15672/api/user-limits/guest/max-connections -d '{"value": 100}'

## Health Check Endpoints {#health-checks}

### GET /api/health/checks/alarms

Responds a 200 OK if there are no alarms in effect in the cluster,
otherwise responds with a 503 Service Unavailable.

Relevant documentation guide: <a href="./alarms">Resource Alarms</a>.

### GET /api/health/checks/local-alarms

Responds a 200 OK if there are no alarms in effect in the cluster,
otherwise responds with a 503 Service Unavailable.

Relevant documentation guide: <a href="./alarms">Resource Alarms</a>.

### GET /api/health/checks/certificate-expiration/\{_within_\}/\{_unit_\}

Checks the expiration date of every certificate found in the PEM certificate bundles used by
all TLS-enabled listeners on the node, regardless of the "type" of the certificate (leaf/server identity,
intermediary or any CA).

Responds a 200 OK if all certificates are valid (have not expired),
otherwise responds with a 503 Service Unavailable.

This health assumes that

<ul>
  <li>All certificates included in the PEM bundles on the nodes are relevant to RabbitMQ clients, plugins or encrypted inter-node communication</li>
  <li>Expired certificates is not a normal operating condition and any expired certificate found must be reported with a check failure</li>
</ul>

Do not use this health check if some of these assumptions are not true.

Valid units: days, weeks, months, years. The value of the \{_within_\} argument is the number of
units. So, when \{_within_\} is 2 and \{_unit_\} is "months", the expiration period used by the check
will be the next two months.

Relevant documentation guides: <a href="./ssl">TLS</a>, <a href="./clustering-ssl">Encrypted Inter-node Communication</a>.

### GET /api/health/checks/port-listener/\{_port_\}

Responds a 200 OK if there is an active listener on the given port,
otherwise responds with a 503 Service Unavailable.

Relevant documentation guides: <a href="./networking">Networking</a>.

### GET /api/health/checks/protocol-listener/\{_protocols_\}

Responds a 200 OK if if all given protocols have active listeners,
otherwise responds with a 503 Service Unavailable. Multiple protocols
may be provided by separating the names with commas.

Valid protocol names are: `amqp`, `mqtt`, `stomp`, `web-mqtt`, `web-stomp`.
To check for the encrypted listeners, add an `s` to the protocol name, for
example `amqps` or `mqtts`.

### GET /api/health/checks/virtual-hosts

Responds a 200 OK if all virtual hosts and running on the target node,
otherwise responds with a 503 Service Unavailable.

### GET /api/health/checks/node-is-quorum-critical

Checks if there are quorum queues with minimum online quorum (queues that
would lose their quorum and availability if the target node is shut down).
Responds a 200 OK if there are no such quorum queues,
otherwise responds with a 503 Service Unavailable.

Relevant documentation guide: <a href="./quorum-queues">Quorum Queues</a>.

### GET /api/health/checks/is-in-service

Responds a 200 OK if the target node is booted, running, and ready to
serve clients, otherwise responds with a 503 Service Unavailable. If the
target node is being drained for maintenance then this check returns 503
Service Unavailable.

### GET /api/health/checks/below-node-connection-limit

Responds a 200 OK if the target node has fewer connections to the AMQP
and AMQPS ports than the configured maximum, otherwise responds with a
503 Service Unavailable.

### GET /api/health/checks/ready-to-serve-clients

Responds a 200 OK if the target node is ready to serve clients, otherwise
responds with a 503 Service Unavailable. This check combines:

* `/api/health/checks/is-in-service`
* `/api/health/checks/protocol-listener/amqp` or `/api/health/checks/protocol-listener/amqps`
* `/api/health/checks/below-node-connection-limit`

So this check will only return 200 OK if the target node is in service,
an AMQP or AMQPS listener is available and the target node has fewer active
AMQP and AMQPS connections that its configured limit.

### GET /api/rebalance/queues

Rebalances all queues in all vhosts.

This operation is asynchronous. Inspect [RabbitMQ logs](./logging/)
for messages regarding the success or failure of the operation.

```

### GET /api/extensions

A list of registered extensions to the management plugin.


## Metrics Returned by the HTTP API

Most of the GET requests you can issue to the HTTP API return
JSON objects with a large number of keys. While a few of these
keys represent things you set yourself in a PUT request or AMQP
command (e.g. queue durability or arguments), most of them
represent statistics to do with the object in question. This
page attempts to document them.

<p>
  It should be read in conjunction with the manual page
  for <code>rabbitmqctl</code> (see your installation if on Unix / Linux,
  or <a href="./rabbitmqctl.8.html">the RabbitMQ website</a> for the latest version).

  Any field which can be returned by a command of the form

  ```shell
  rabbitmqctl list_{object}
  ```

  ```shell
  rabbitmqctl list_{object}
  ```

  will also be returned in the
  equivalent part of the HTTP API, so all those keys are not
  documented here. However, the HTTP API returns additional metrics compared to the
  standard [CLI tools](./cli) and [`rabbitmqadmin` v2](./management-cli/) alike.
</p>

<h2>_details objects</h2>
<p>
  Many fields represent a count of some kind: queue length,
  messages acknowledged, bytes received and so on. Such absolute
  counts returned by the HTTP API will often have a
  corresponding <code>_details</code> object which offers
  information on how this count has changed. So for example, from
  a queue:

  ```json
  "messages": 123619,
  "messages_details": {
    "avg": 41206.333333333336,
    "avg_rate": 1030.1583333333333,
    "rate": 24723.8,
    "samples": [
      {
        "sample": 123619,
        "timestamp": 1400680560000
      },
      {
        "sample": 0,
        "timestamp": 1400680500000
      },
      {
        "sample": 0,
        "timestamp": 1400680440000
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
</p>

<p>
  Here we have a <code>messages</code> count (the total messages
  in the queue), with some additional data:
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
      <td><code>avg</code></td>
      <td>
      The average value for the requested time period (see below).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>avg_rate</code></td>
      <td>
      The average rate for the requested time period.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>rate</code></td>
      <td>
      How much the count has changed per second in the most recent
      sampling interval.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>samples</code></td>
      <td>
      Snapshots showing how the value has changed over the
      requested time period.
      </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
  <code>avg</code>, <code>avg_rate</code> and <code>samples</code>
  will only appear if you request a specific time period by
  appending query parameters to the URL. To do this you need to
  set an age and an increment for the samples you want. The end of
  the range returned will always correspond to the present.
</p>

<p>
  Different types of data take different query parameters to
  return samples, as in the following table. You can specify more
  than one set of parameters if the resource you are requesting
  can generate more than one type of sample (for example, queues
  can return message rates and queue lengths).
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
      <td>Messages sent and received</td>
      <td>`msg_rates_age` / `msg_rates_incr`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bytes sent and received</td>
      <td>`data_rates_age` / `data_rates_incr`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Queue lengths</td>
      <td>`lengths_age` / `lengths_incr`</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Node statistics (e.g. file descriptors, disk space free)</td>
      <td>`node_stats_age` / `node_stats_incr`</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
  For example,
  appending <code>?lengths_age=3600&lengths_incr=60</code> will
  return the last hour's data on queue lengths, with a sample for
  every minute.
</p>

<h2>message_stats objects</h2>
<p>
  Many objects (including queues, exchanges and channels) will
  return counts of messages passing through them. These are
  included in a <code>message_stats</code> object (which in turn
  will contain <code>_details</code> objects for each count, as
  described above).
</p>
<p>
  These can contain:
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
      <td><code>publish</code></td>
      <td>
      Count of messages published.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>publish_in</code></td>
      <td>
      Count of messages published "in" to an exchange, i.e. not
      taking account of routing.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>publish_out</code></td>
      <td>
      Count of messages published "out" of an exchange,
      i.e. taking account of routing.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>confirm</code></td>
      <td>
      Count of messages confirmed.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>deliver</code></td>
      <td>
      Count of messages delivered in acknowledgement mode to consumers.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>deliver_no_ack</code></td>
      <td>
      Count of messages delivered in no-acknowledgement mode to consumers.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>get</code></td>
      <td>
      Count of messages delivered in acknowledgement mode in
      response to basic.get.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>get_no_ack</code></td>
      <td>
      Count of messages delivered in no-acknowledgement mode in
      response to basic.get.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>deliver_get</code></td>
      <td>
      Sum of all four of the above.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>redeliver</code></td>
      <td>
      Count of subset of messages in <code>deliver_get</code>
      which had the redelivered flag set.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>drop_unroutable</code></td>
      <td>
      Count of messages dropped as unroutable.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>return_unroutable</code></td>
      <td>
      Count of messages returned to the publisher as unroutable.
      </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Only fields for which some activity has taken place will appear.
</p>

<h2>Detailed message stats objects</h2>
<p>
  In addition, queues, exchanges and channels can return a
  breakdown of message stats for each of their neighbours
  (i.e. adjacent objects in the chain: channel -> exchange ->
  queue -> channel). This will only happen if
  the <code>rates_mode</code> configuration item has been switched
  to <code>detailed</code> from its default of <code>basic</code>.
</p>
<p>
  As this possibly constitutes a large quantity of data, it is also
  only returned when querying a single channel, queue or exchange
  rather than a list. Note also that the default sample retention
  policy means that these detailed message stats do not retain
  historical data for more than a few seconds.
</p>
<p>
  The detailed message stats objects have different names
  depending on where they are (documented below). Each set of
  detailed stats consists of a list of objects with two fields,
  one identifying the partner object and one <code>stats</code>
  which is a message_stats object as described above.
</p>
<p>
  Here is an example snippet:

  ```json
  "incoming": [
    {
      "stats": {
        "publish": 352593,
        "publish_details": {
          "rate": 100.2
        }
      },
      "exchange": {
        "name": "my-exchange",
        "vhost": "/"
      }
    }
    {
      "stats": {
        "publish": 543784,
        "publish_details": {
          "rate": 54.6
        }
      },
      "exchange": {
        "name": "amq.topic",
        "vhost": "/"
      }
    }
  ],
  ```
</p>

<p>
  This queue is currently receiving messages from two exchanges:
  100.2 msg/s from "my-exchange" and 54.6 msg/s from "amq.topic".

  <h2> Pagination Parameters</h2>

  <p>
    The pagination can be applied to the endpoints that list

    <ul>
      <li>queues</li>
      <li>exchanges</li>
      <li>connections</li>
      <li>channels</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Without pagination, these endpoints can produce very large JSON responses and waste a lot of bandwidth and CPU resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    Default page size is 100, maximum supported page size is 500.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below are the query parameters that can be used.
