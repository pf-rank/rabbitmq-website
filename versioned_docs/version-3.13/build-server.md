# Server Build Instructions

## Overview {#overview}

This section describes the process for obtaining a copy of the
RabbitMQ server source code, as well as instructions for building the
server from source.

## Open Source RabbitMQ Build Infrastructure is Open Source

Except for the secrets, certificates and package distribution infrastructure (such as `deb*.rabbitmq.com` or `yum*.rabbitmq.com`),
open source RabbitMQ's build infrastructure is developed in the open on GitHub:

 * [`rabbitmq/build-env-images`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/build-env-images) provides the OCI images used for producing releases
 * [`rabbitmq/server-packages`](https://github.com/rabbitmq/server-packages) provides the GitHub Actions workflows


## Build from Source {#git}

First, get the source code from [our GitHub repositories](/github):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server.git rabbitmq
```

Then, use GNU Make to pull down dependencies and build the server and all plugins
that ship with the RabbitMQ distribution:

```bash
cd rabbitmq
make
```


## Required Libraries and Tools {#prerequisites}

In order to build RabbitMQ, a few tools must be installed.

### Python

RabbitMQ requires a reasonably recent version of [Python](http://www.python.org/download/) and [simplejson](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson).

simplejson.py is included as a standard json library in the Python distribution.

### Erlang/OTP Toolchain and Headers

The [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/./download) development and runtime tools
are needed to compile RabbitMQ server, tools and [tier 1 plugins](./plugins).

See [Erlang Version Requirements](./which-erlang) to learn about the range of supported Erlang release series.

On a Debian-based system, the `erlang-nox`, `erlang-dev` and
`erlang-src` packages must be installed.

### Elixir

A recent version of [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) is needed
to build [RabbitMQ CLI tools](./cli).

### GNU Make

[GNU make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is the primary build tool
used by RabbitMQ.

### xsltproc and xmlto

A recent version of `xsltproc`, which is part of [libxslt](http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/) and
`xmlto` must be available.

### zip and unzip

[zip](http://www.info-zip.org/Zip.html) and [unzip](http://www.info-zip.org/UnZip.html)
would be necessary if source code is obtained via an archive instead of a git repository clone.


## Building the Server {#building-server}

Change to the `rabbitmq` directory, and type `make`.

Other interesting `Makefile` targets include

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Make Target</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>all</td>
      <td>
      The default target. Builds the server.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>shell</td>
      <td>
      Builds the client libraries and starts an Erlang shell with the
      libraries loaded.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>run-broker</td>
      <td>
      Builds the server and starts an instance with an
      interactive Erlang shell. This will by default put
      data, including the node's data directory, under <code>/tmp/rabbitmq-test-instances</code>,
      but this location can be overridden by setting the
      Makefile variable <code>TEST_TMPDIR</code>:

      ```bash
      make run-broker TEST_TMPDIR="/some/other/location/for/rabbitmq-test-instances"
      ```

      The Erlang node name can also be changed by setting
      <code>RABBITMQ_NODENAME</code>:

      ```bash
      make run-broker RABBITMQ_NODENAME=rmq
      ```

      See <a href="./configure">Configuration guide</a> for other
      variables that may be useful.

      <td>Removes all build products, including fetched dependencies.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>tests</td>
      <td>
      Runs multiple server test suites. This is very resource-intensive and will
      take up to a few hours. Many nodes and clusters will be started, modified and destroyed
      by various test suites.

    </tr>

</table>


## Building Packages {#building-packages}

In practice, building RabbitMQ server from source is of limited use
unless an easy to deploy package (e.g. a generic binary build or Debian one) can be produced.

Everything related to packaging the RabbitMQ server is in the [main RabbitMQ repository](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server).

There is a number of top-level packaging Make targets available, one for each package
type (or family of packages, such as RPM):

 * `make package-generic-unix`
 * `make package-deb`
 * `make package-rpm`
 * `make package-rpm-suse`
 * `make package-windows`
